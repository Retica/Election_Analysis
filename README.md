# Election_Analysis
Mod. 3

In this election audit program we were able to read our data from the given excel file. And parce any data that we would like to be displayed in an addition txt file.

1. There were 369,711 total votes cast in this election and we get this information from our two if statments between lines 53 and 76
2. Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855),Denver: 82.8% (306,055),Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801) here is the breakdown of the vote by percent we get this information from our code at like 94 through 99
3. Denver had the largest number of vote we find this information from the same lines of code as the previous information 
4. Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213),Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892),Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
5. Winner: Diana DeGette,Winning Vote Count: 272,892,Winning Percentage: 73.8% 
6. We find the information from the two line above with our program with lines 127-142


With this script we could eliminate many problems with the current way they we handle electing our represenatives. with relative ease we can look at any election and quickly determin and the winner of any election with accuracy. Not only can we get data like the total vote count the percentage of the vote that they got ect ect but any other metrics that we would like to monitor. Not only will this save money in manpower operation costs. But would provide voters a certainty of the results because it minimizes the human bias in elections as much as possible. This script could also be modified to verfiy the overall voter turn out in an election (given the proper data). It could also be modified to see if any voter fraud was committed
